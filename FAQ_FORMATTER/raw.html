<h1><strong>Using Taulia Q&amp;A</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Q. What is Taulia?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A.&nbsp;Taulia is a partner platform that allows SAP suppliers to view the status of their invoices, receive remittance details, and request early payment for approved invoices. All accounts payable processes will continue to be owned by SAP.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q. Who should I invite to my portal account?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A. Please add others to your company who will need access to the portal including for checking invoices, payments, etc.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftauliaknowledge.force.com%2Ftauliasupport%2Farticles%2Fen_US%2FAgent_Knowledge_Base%2FQ-How-do-I-add-or-deactivate-users%2F%3Fq%3Dadd%2Busers%26l%3Den_US%26fs%3DSearch%26pn%3D1&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFrqEzclL-DLOFd1WbNjyZZ2V6Xb3TQzvw"" target=""_blank"">Click here</a>&nbsp;to learn how to add users to your account.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please be informed that the maintenance of your Taulia account is fully under&nbsp;<strong>your responsibility</strong>.</p>

<p>Make sure that in the event of any change (users leaving your company, access removal, new admins, split/merge of companies, etc) your designated Taulia&nbsp;<strong>account administrator</strong>&nbsp;manages the complete access in the User Manager, by activating or deactivating users&nbsp;appropriately.</p>

<p>If you have only one admin user on the account, please be sure to add a new admin user before you leave the company. This will ensure that your company does not lose access to your Taulia portal.</p>

<h1><strong>Early Payment &amp; Discounting Q&amp;A</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Use the Taulia platform to accelerate the payment of your invoices through the early payment options.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q. I have questions regarding the early payment rates for invoices. Who should I contact?</strong></p>

	<li>A. Please contact&nbsp;<a href=""https://support.taulia.com/pkb_contact?exp=tau80v1"" target=""_blank"">Taulia Support</a>&nbsp;for any early payment related questions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q. Why do some approved invoices do not have an early payment offer?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A. Not every approved invoice will have an early payment offer. It is within SAP discretion to offer early payment on any approved invoice. Please contact SAP if you have question.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q. </strong><strong>My invoice is approved but I can&#39;t request/accept early payment. Why?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Your company is not part of SAP early payment program. (contact SAP to confirm)</li>
	<li>If you want to request early payment for the&nbsp;first time&nbsp;and you have multiple bank accounts registered with SAP that is showing in the&nbsp;<strong>My Details &gt; Bank Accounts</strong>&nbsp;section of the portal. You must contact&nbsp;<a href=""http://support.taulia.com/pkb_contact?b=&amp;l=en_US"" target=""_blank"">Taulia Support</a>&nbsp;first and inform them that you are not able to see early payment offers due to having multiple bank accounts. Let them know which bank account you would like to use to receive early payment. Once the bank account for early payment is specificied, you will start seeing the early payment offers for your approved invoices.</li>
	<li>The current date is too close to the invoice due date.</li>
	<li>Due to credit notes in your account.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q. I have questions regarding the early payment rates for invoices. Who should I contact?</strong></p>
